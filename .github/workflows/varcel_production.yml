# events but only for the master branch

jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@master

      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
      - name: vue-cli-service lint
        run: echo linting...

      # Runs a set of commands using the runners shell
      - name: setup-node@master
